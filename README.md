# IT Documentation Portfolio  

**By DANIEL MOREL – IT Support Specialist | Tier 1 | Home Lab Projects & Self-Taught**


Welcome to my IT Documentation Portfolio. This space is a testament to the intensive, hands-on application of technical knowledge gained over many months. My work spans critical domains, from core system administration and cutting-edge cloud technologies to practical, day-to-day skills like remote troubleshooting and support. My commitment is to deliver documentation that proves my problem-solving capabilities and professional readiness, focusing on substance over buzzwords. I am genuinely eager to contribute my best to a team and help solve real-world IT challenges.

## About Me

As an aspiring IT Support Specialist, my foundation is rooted in practical application. I have cultivated a robust skillset through hands-on lab projects, detailed troubleshooting exercises, and consistent documentation practices. Crucially, I complement this technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills honed during my time in customer service and technical support, including experience with video and onsite interpretation. This background has sharpened my ability to communicate clearly, maintain composure under pressure, and prioritize user empathy—ensuring not only that technical problems are solved, but that every user interaction results in a positive, effective experience

I am actively engaged in studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification, a key step in my professional trajectory. Crucially, I have deliberately structured my approach to complement this theoretical knowledge with robust hands-on experience gained through lab work and real-world scenarios. My ambition is to secure a remote role in a Managed Service Provider (MSP) or IT team that values practical application. I am dedicated to being a major contributor to a dynamic environment where continuous learning translates directly into tangible value
