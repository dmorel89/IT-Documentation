# How to Get Started with Windows Server 2022 (Hands-on project)

## **🖥️What is Windows Server** ?

 Windows Server: Enterprise Backbone for IT Infrastructure
Windows Server is a robust, enterprise-grade operating system developed by Microsoft to support and manage corporate IT environments. Unlike consumer-focused platforms like Windows 10 or 11, Windows Server
is engineered for centralized administration, scalability, and security across networks.

Windows Server acts as the central nervous system of a business’s IT infrastructure—coordinating devices, users, and services to ensure seamless operations. My experience with it has laid the foundation for deeper
learning in network administration, virtualization, and cloud integration.

- Various Versions of Windows Server  
Windows Server 2003, 2008 & R2, 2012 & R2, 2016, 2019 and 2022.

As a Level 1 Helpdesk Technician, I’ve worked with Windows Server to support and maintain critical infrastructure components:

🔐 User & Resource Management
Active Directory (AD): Created and managed user accounts, groups, and organizational units. Supported password resets, access control, and login troubleshooting.

Group Policy (GPO): Applied and troubleshot policies to enforce security settings, desktop configurations, and software restrictions across multiple machines.

📁 File Sharing & Security
Configured shared folders with NTFS and share-level permissions to ensure secure access.

Implemented firewall rules and software restrictions to maintain endpoint security and compliance.

🌐 Network Services
Supported DNS and DHCP configurations to ensure devices could locate each other and receive IP addresses dynamically.

Assisted in Remote Desktop Services (RDS) setup for remote access and support.

Monitored and maintained Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for system health and inventory reporting.

🧠 Virtualization & System Roles
Deployed and managed virtual machines using Hyper-V, optimizing resource usage and isolating environments for testing and training.

Participated in the configuration of server roles such as File Services, 
Print Services, and Backup Solutions to support business continuity.
